# StreamYourAd

Source code behind the original StreamYourAd.com site.

### Some Notes

* This site was originally constructed for a startup company in the Greater New York City area which has since been dissolved. As such, I have been offered permission to repurpose the site as I see fit.
* Primary design credit goes to Genevieve Calingo. I was responsible for responsive layouts and any interactive states/animations throughout the site.
